# Spelling Bee Solver

This is a simple little application to solve the NYTime's spelling bee. A Node.Js / Express back end and a React front end. First time using hooks in React. The word finder uses a trie to hold an english dictionary.

## TODO
1. Cleanup. It's poorly organized, especially on the client side.
2. Find a ...less complete? dictionary. There's quite a lot of words that don't seem to be words.
3. Sort out development flow vis a vis running the front and back end at the same time. CRA uses a proxy.
